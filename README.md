# recursive-resize

This simple command-line tool takes a directory and will resize all images within that directory to a specified file size outputting them in a the same folder structure in an output directory. It can also generate thumbnails of an even smaller size.

To install, use `npm install -g recursive-resize`

To run, you use `recursive-resize` (or if you're like me and that's too many letters, you can use `recres` instead.)
